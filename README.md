# AnonymousBlog
## A website where people may post freely/anonymously without fear of judgement or persecution
## HackDSC Submission
You mat find the website hosted on heroku here https://fathomless-beach-85767.herokuapp.com/ or **http://asafeplace.online** (that is the domain I registered with Domain.com for their challenge)

# What is this site?
This is a fully-featured blogging/forum web app where users may sign up for and post under an anonymous account.

## We try to ensure privacy by:
  * not asking for email
  * not asking for name
  * not taking any of your information other than the username you provided

## Anonymous users who have signed in may:
  * create a new post
  * update and delete their existing posts
  * reply to other posts
  
## Users not signed in may:
  * register for an account
  * login to an existing account
  * view other members' posts and replies to those posts

# Why Consider This Project?
### Best Domain Registered With Domain.com
The domain **http://asafeplace.online** is a clever use of the .online TLD, and is relevant to the project, since this web app is meant to be a safe place for people to chat/post/discuss anonymously without fear of judgement.

# Technologies Used
#### Front-end
  * HTML, CSS, JS
  * Bootstrap 4.4
  
#### Back-end
  * Flask
  * SQLite
  
###### Note: This web app was inspired by a tutorial made by Corey Schafer, therefore there may be similarities in project structure, naming conventions and boilerplate code. Corey's tutorial can be viewed here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH
###### Rest assured this code is unique and created by myself, and much of the functionality is different than in the tutorial.
